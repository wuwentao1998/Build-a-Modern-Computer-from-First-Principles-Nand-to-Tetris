# compiler

This repository contains three simple compilers, including a assembler, a virtual machine and a compiler which can compile a high-level language called Jack.

I realized these three compilers following the instruction of a book called The Elements of Computering System. This is a brilliantly written book which teach me a lot about operating principle of a computer.
